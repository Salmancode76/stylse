# Stylize
Reboot ascii art web project


//todo
    Description:


    The Stylize project, from ASCII Web, extends the original ascii-art-web by creating a web-based interface using Go (Golang) for server-side logic and HTML/CSS for the frontend. This server accepts POST requests with text and a banner type (standard, shadow, or thinkertoy), processes the input through a modified ASCII art program, and returns the generated art for display on the web page. CSS plays a crucial role in making the site more appealing, interactive, and user-friendly.
